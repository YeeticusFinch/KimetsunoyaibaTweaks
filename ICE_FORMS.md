## First Form: Paralyzing Icicle

The swordsman will stab their sword into the enemy with incredible speed and power, enough to shock and paralyze the enemy for a short moment.
Animation: kimetsunoyaiba:speed_attack_sword (this is a stab)
Launch the player forwards a little bit, the target(s) hit by this ability will gain extreme slowness and mining fatigue for like 8 seconds
Particles: minecraft:snowflake, kimetsunoyaiba:particle_frozen
Sounds: minecraft:entity.player.attack.strong, block.glass.break

## Second Form: Winter Wrath

The swordsman maneuvers themselves and circles the enemy. They would slowly close in the gap between them and the enemy, delivering rotational slashes at the same time.
Animations: kimetsunoyaiba:ragnaraku1, kimetsunoyaiba:sword_to_right, kimetsunoyaiba:sword_to_left
Player will circle the target (either a point on the crosshair 5 blocks away, or the nearest living entity to the crosshair)
There will be many attacks against all living entities within that circle
Particles: minecraft:snowflake, kimetsunoyaiba:particle_frozen, minecraft:sweep_attack
Sounds: minecraft:entity.player.attack.sweep

## Third Form: Merciful Hail Fall

The swordsman leaps up and delivers multiple gentle yet powerful slashes downwards. With this, the enemy would not feel any pain and can die peacefully.
Animations: kimetsunoyaiba:ragnaraku2 (this raises the sword above the head), kimetsunoyaiba:ragnaraku3 (this slashes the sword downwards)
The player leaps upwards and hovers in the air for a few seconds while they deliver multiple downwards slashes (go back and forth between the two animations, canceling the previous one before starting the next, and be sure to restart the animation each time)
Particles: minecraft:block (make it packed ice), minecraft:explosion (in large vertical arcs)
Sounds: minecraft:entity.player.attack.sweep, minecraft:weather.rain

## Fourth Form: Silent Avalanche

The nimble and silent swordsman dashes to the enemy with incredible speed. While doing so, they swing their sword around to build up power, much like an avalanche. Upon reaching the enemy, they deliver a single, powerful slash that is enough to decapitate the enemy.
Animations: kimetsunoyaiba:kamusari3, kimetsunoyaiba:sword_to_left
Teleports the player 10 blocks forwards (or to the nearest living entity target on the crosshair) and then does a big slash forwards
Particles: minecraft:cloud, minecraft:snowflake
Sounds: minecraft:block.snow.break

## Fifth Form: Cold Blue Assault

The swordsman simply dashes to the enemy and swiftly slashes them. This is the easiest form to master, but the weakest (depending on the user's strength).
Animations: kimetsunoyaiba:kamusari3, kimetsunoyaiba:sword_rotate
The player runs forwards pretty fast on the ground while constantly attacking all around with the sword
Particles: minecraft:block (blue ice), kimetsunoyaiba:particle_frozen
Sounds: minecraft:entity.player.attack.sweep, block.glass.break

## Sixth Form: Snowflake Cycle

The swordsman leaps into the air and spins their sword above them with incredible speed and strength, enough to confuse the enemy. Once within range, the swordsman delivers either a horizontal slash, cutting the enemy into half.
Animations: kimetsunoyaiba:ragnaraku1 (this spins the sword above the head at the beginning of the attack), kimetsunoyaiba:sword_rotate (this is the slash)
The player jumps upwards and forwards, spinning the sword above their head and then doing the big horizontal sword slash for lots of damage and nausea effect
Particles: minecraft:snowflake
Sounds: minecraft:entity.player.attack.sweep, minecraft:block.snow.break

## Seventh Form: Icicle Claws

(7th form only available for Shimizu's sword)

The swordsman starts by thrusting their sword into the enemy's eyes, blinding them. The swordsman thrusts their sword into the enemy in all directions, with full power. The swordsman then finishes them off with a final slash to the neck.
Animations: kimetsunoyaiba:speed_attack_sword (this is a stab to the eyes, which gives the enemy blindness), kimetsunoyaiba:sword_to_left, kimetsunoyaiba:sword_to_right, kimetsunoyaiba:sword_overhead, kimetsunoyaiba:sword_to_upper
The player begins by stabbing forwards (blinding the living entities directly in front of the player within 5 blocks, 15 seconds of blindness), and then the player does a whole bunch of slashes super quickly (alternating between the 4 different sword slashing animations)
Particle: minecraft:block (packed ice), kimetsunoyaiba:particle_frozen
Sounds: minecraft:entity.player.attack.strong, block.glass.break, minecraft:entity.player.attack.sweep
