## Act 1: The Cork Shatters Cold Silence

The user spins with slowly increasing speed in order to build momentum like pressure in a bottle of ferment, speed capped only by user's own ability as they slowly shift their weigh and concentrate their entire body's weight into a single blow  aimed at major organs


## Act 2: The first shot's burn.

Slowing breathing to maximize both heat transfer and generation, inside and out. the longer the user maintains breath, the longer the user is able to melt ice on contact with their skin and remain warm in blistering cold


## Act 3: Winter rum's warmth

Beginning with act 2, the breath control used to maintain heat is now concentrating it while grip on the blade is increased. Through the searing heat transferred up the blade, the user burns as they leap between vertical surfaces, gaining momentum each time as they leap off. Between speed and heat, wounds are not given a chance to heal before more are inflicted.


## Act 4: Distiller's balance

The user steadies themselves and their breathing in such a way to minimize energy use and maximize awareness while hyper-oxygenating the blood in order to expend incredible energy toward momentum. Blades extended, the user uses their momentum and body-weight to maximize force as they slice through their opponent at multiple angles simultaneously


## Act 5: Bitter yeast sediment

A series of blows are made to the abdomen of the demon, each followed by a blisteringly fast jab from the blade(s) of the weapon, as the impacts and wounds saturate, damage to old incisions break apart the flesh. The instant the innards are visible, they are to quickly and precisely obliterate all major and most minor organs faster than pain can register. Much like the death of yeast leaving sediment at the bottom of fermentation jugs, so too do the minced flesh of a demon fall away as their death approaches

## Act 6: Loose Lipped Drunkard

With a single blade extended, the opposite handle is used to whip around the blade at such a pace that attacks made to the side being parried against will be instead shredded to paste, dropping and falling like a dark secret falling from the lips of a drunk

## Act 7: Last Call

Combining the first 6 acts in careful measurements like a carefully made cocktail for the last customer of the bar, The user starts with minimizing movements and creating space to breathe before emerging from cover with steadied breath and high speed, strenuous on the body but required to create the full force required. as the user gets in close physical combat with the demon and with both blades out exerts themself specifically to concentrate momentum. Lastly, the user maneuvers just offcenter to the demon in order to create the rotational force needed as they carve the body to ribbons. As one blade slips out, the other gets stabbed deep to continue until all momentum is lost or the demon is dead.
