## Architecture Overview

### Core Structure
- **Main Mod Class**: `src/main/java/com/lerdorf/kimetsunoyaibamultiplayer/KimetsunoyaibaMultiplayer.java`
  - Handles mod initialization, event registration, and lifecycle management
  - Registers blocks, items, and creative tabs using DeferredRegister
  - Contains client-side event handling in nested `ClientModEvents` class

- **Configuration**: `src/main/java/com/lerdorf/kimetsunoyaibamultiplayer/Config.java`
  - Uses ForgeConfigSpec for mod configuration
  - Provides example config values (logDirtBlock, magicNumber, items list)
  - Automatically validates and converts config values on load

### Event System
The mod uses Forge's event bus system:
- **Mod Event Bus**: For mod lifecycle events (setup, config loading)
- **Forge Event Bus**: For game events (server starting, etc.)
- **Client-only Events**: Handled in `ClientModEvents` nested class with `@Mod.EventBusSubscriber`

### Dependencies
- **External Library**: `player-animation-lib-forge-1.20.1-1.0.2-rc1.jar` in `libs/` directory
- **Forge Dependency**: Declared in `build.gradle` as deobfuscated dependency
- **Config**: Uses ForgeConfigSpec for configuration management

### Resource Structure
- **Mod Metadata**: `src/main/resources/META-INF/mods.toml` - Contains mod information and dependencies
- **Pack Metadata**: `src/main/resources/pack.mcmeta` - Resource pack version info
- **Generated Resources**: `src/generated/resources/` - Output from data generators

## Test Commands

The mod includes test commands to verify the animation sync system is working:

### Server-side Command: `/testanim`
- Available on servers and LAN worlds
- Plays the "sword_to_left" animation on all connected players
- Sends animation packets to all clients
- Useful for testing multiplayer animation synchronization

### Client-side Command: `/testanimc`
- Available in single-player and on clients
- Plays the animation locally and sends sync packet to server
- Useful for testing client-to-server animation transmission

Both commands will show debug messages if debug mode is enabled in the config.

## Key Development Notes

### Mod Registration Pattern
The mod uses DeferredRegister pattern for all registrations:
- Create DeferredRegister instances for each registry type
- Register objects as RegistryObject fields
- Register the DeferredRegister to the mod event bus in constructor

### Configuration System
Config values are defined as ForgeConfigSpec values and cached as static fields. The `Config.onLoad()` method handles updating cached values when config changes.

### Client/Server Separation
Client-only code is properly separated using `@Mod.EventBusSubscriber(value = Dist.CLIENT)` and the `ClientModEvents` nested class pattern.

### Animation Library Integration
The mod depends on both `player-animation-lib-forge` and `mobplayeranimator` for multiplayer animation synchronization:
- **PlayerAnimator**: Provides the base animation framework for detecting and creating animations
- **Mob Player Animator**: Extends PlayerAnimator to enable animations on other players/mobs (critical for multiplayer sync)
- Both libraries are declared as dependencies in `build.gradle` and `mods.toml`

### Animation System Architecture
1. **Animation Detection** (`AnimationTracker.java`): Uses reflection to detect active KeyframeAnimationPlayer instances in the local player's AnimationStack
2. **Network Synchronization** (`AnimationSyncPacket.java`, `ModNetworking.java`): Transmits animation events between client and server
3. **Animation Application** (`AnimationSyncHandler.java`): Receives animation sync packets and applies animations to other players using Mob Player Animator
4. **Fallback System**: If original animation cannot be found, tries kimetsunoyaiba animations like "sword_to_left" as fallbacks

### Key Lessons Learned
- **PlayerAnimator Limitation**: The base PlayerAnimator library can only apply animations to the local player, not to other players
- **Mob Player Animator Solution**: This extension enables animations on other players, solving the core multiplayer sync requirement
- **Animation Registry**: Finding animations by ResourceLocation can be challenging; fallback strategies are essential
- **Reflection Usage**: Animation detection requires reflection to access private fields in AnimationStack and ModifierLayer classes
- **Animation Name vs UUID Issue**: KeyframeAnimation objects have UUIDs, but the registry stores animations by their simple names (e.g., "sword_to_left")
- **Multiple Registry Lookup**: Animations may be registered under different namespaces ("kimetsunoyaiba", "playeranimator", etc.)

### Animation Identification Strategy
The mod uses a multi-step approach to extract animation names:
1. **extraData Field**: First tries to extract name from KeyframeAnimation.extraData
2. **Reflection Scan**: Searches all fields for strings matching known animation names
3. **Known Names List**: Validates against the complete list of kimetsunoyaiba animation names
4. **Multiple Namespace Search**: Tries various ResourceLocation combinations during registry lookup

## Breathing Technique System

The mod implements a comprehensive breathing technique system for custom nichirin swords with special abilities.

### Architecture Overview

#### Core Components

1. **BreathingSwordItem** (`items/BreathingSwordItem.java`)
   - Abstract base class for all breathing swords
   - Extends `SwordItem` with Diamond tier stats (3 attack damage, -2.4 attack speed)
   - Handles right-click activation of breathing forms
   - Manages form cycling with R key integration
   - Displays form names with color codes (ยง6 for technique, ยงb for form name)

2. **BreathingForm** (`breathingtechnique/BreathingForm.java`)
   - Data class representing a single breathing technique form
   - Contains: name, description, cooldown, and effect executor
   - Effect is a BiConsumer<Player, Level> lambda for maximum flexibility

3. **BreathingTechnique** (`breathingtechnique/BreathingTechnique.java`)
   - Container for a complete set of breathing forms
   - Manages form indexing and retrieval
   - Each technique has a unique name and list of forms

4. **AnimationHelper** (`breathingtechnique/AnimationHelper.java`)
   - Centralized animation playback system
   - Supports timed animations with automatic cancellation
   - `playAnimation(player, name)` - plays full animation
   - `playAnimation(player, name, maxTicks)` - plays animation with max duration (used for attack animations, limited to 10 ticks)
   - Handles client-side playback and network synchronization
   - Uses threaded scheduling for animation cancellation

5. **AbilityScheduler** (`breathingtechnique/AbilityScheduler.java`)
   - Server-side task scheduler for delayed/repeated actions
   - `scheduleOnce(player, action, delayTicks)` - one-time delayed execution
   - `scheduleRepeating(player, action, intervalTicks, durationTicks)` - repeated execution
   - Tick-based execution synchronized with server tick event
   - Automatically cleans up completed tasks

6. **PlayerBreathingData** (`breathingtechnique/PlayerBreathingData.java`)
   - Stores per-player breathing technique state
   - Tracks currently selected form index for each player
   - Thread-safe UUID-based storage
   - Persists form selection during gameplay session

### Implemented Breathing Techniques

#### Ice Breathing (nichirinsword_ice, nichirinsword_hanazawa)
- **Particle Effects**: Light blue dust particles (RGB: 0.5, 0.8, 1.0)
- **7 Forms Total**:
  1. **Paralyzing Icicle**: Speed thrust attack with slowness/mining fatigue debuffs (5 block range)
  2. **Winter Wrath**: Circular attack pattern around target with tornado-like particles
  3. **Merciful Hail Fall**: Aerial hovering with rapid downward slashes
  4. **Flash Freeze Path**: Ice block path creation with teleportation
  5. **Frozen Barrage**: High-speed multi-directional attacks
  6. **Arctic Devastation**: Ground slam with freeze effect
  7. **Absolute Zero** (Hanazawa exclusive): Ultimate freezing technique

#### Frost Breathing (nichirinsword_frost, nichirinsword_hiori)
- **Particle Effects**: Snowflake particles
- **7 Forms Total**:
  1. **Frost Blade Rush**: Triple forward thrust
  2. **Whirling Snowstorm**: Spinning AoE attack
  3. **Crystalline Spear**: Piercing ice projectile
  4. **Glacial Prison**: Ice wall creation
  5. **Diamond Dust Barrage**: Rapid multi-hit combo
  6. **Permafrost Domain**: Area freeze effect
  7. **Eternal Winter** (Hiori exclusive): Ultimate frost technique

### Key Implementation Details

#### Attack Animations
- **Left-click attacks** trigger animations for all breathing swords via `BreathingSwordAnimationHandler`
- Animations play on air clicks, block clicks, and entity hits
- **10-tick animation limit** for basic attacks (sword_to_left, sword_to_right, sword_overhead) to prevent animation lock
- 5% chance for overhead animation, otherwise alternates left/right
- Animations are synchronized across multiplayer using `AnimationSyncPacket`

#### AOE Attack System
- All breathing swords have **automatic AoE attacks** (3x3x3 cube in front of player)
- Triggered on any left-click attack via `LivingAttackEvent`
- Damage is applied to all entities in range except primary target and attacker
- Sweep attack particles provide visual feedback
- Range: 2 blocks forward from player's eye position

#### Particle System Integration
- **Particle filtering**: `speed_attack_sword` and `ragnaraku` animations skip automatic sword particles
- Breathing forms control their own particle effects
- Particles configured per-sword in `SwordParticleMapping.java`
- Config-based particle customization supported via `particles.toml`

#### Ice Breathing Second Form - Advanced Implementation
Special velocity-based circular attack pattern:
- **Target Detection**: Raycasts 6 blocks to find entity on crosshair
- **Movement System**: Uses `setDeltaMovement()` for smooth circular motion (no teleportation)
- **Rotation Control**: Player always faces circle center with calculated yaw/pitch
- **Particle Effects**:
  - Spiral tornado pattern around player (8 particles per tick)
  - Sweep attack particles every 3 ticks
  - Circular path markers (12 snowflakes around circle)
- **Attack Pattern**: 3 attacks per second (every 7 ticks) with alternating sword animations
- **Speed**: 3x angular velocity for fast rotation
- **Duration**: 5 seconds (100 ticks)

### Form Cycling System
- Press **R key** to cycle through forms (configured via `ModKeyBindings`)
- Current form index stored per-player in `PlayerBreathingData`
- Selected form displayed in chat with color-coded message
- Form selection persists until changed or player disconnects

### Cooldown System
- Each form has individual cooldown in seconds
- Cooldowns displayed on hotbar as item cooldown overlay
- Cooldown message shown when attempting to use ability on cooldown
- Cooldowns are per-item (all swords of same type share cooldown)

### Particle Configuration
Breathing sword particles are configured in:
- `SwordParticleMapping.java` - hardcoded fallback mappings
- `config/kimetsunoyaibamultiplayer/particles.toml` - runtime particle customization
- Ice swords return `DustParticleOptions` with light blue color
- Frost swords return `ParticleTypes.SNOWFLAKE`

### Best Practices

1. **Adding New Breathing Forms**:
   ```java
   public static BreathingForm newForm() {
       return new BreathingForm(
           "Form Name",
           "Description",
           cooldownSeconds,
           (player, level) -> {
               // Play animation
               AnimationHelper.playAnimation(player, "animation_name");

               // Schedule delayed/repeated actions
               AbilityScheduler.scheduleOnce(player, () -> {
                   // Delayed action
               }, delayTicks);

               // Spawn particles on server
               if (level instanceof ServerLevel serverLevel) {
                   serverLevel.sendParticles(/*...*/);
               }

               // Apply damage/effects to entities
               AABB hitbox = player.getBoundingBox().inflate(range);
               List<LivingEntity> targets = level.getEntitiesOfClass(/*...*/);
           }
       );
   }
   ```

2. **Particle Spawning Patterns**:
   - **Forward thrust**: Use `spawnForwardThrust()` helper for straight-line particles
   - **Circular patterns**: Calculate angles and use trigonometry for positioning
   - **Tornado/spiral**: Combine time-based angle changes with vertical offsets
   - **Always spawn on server**: Check `level instanceof ServerLevel` before spawning

3. **Animation Guidelines**:
   - Use full animation names with namespace: `"kimetsunoyaiba:animation_name"`
   - For timed animations: `AnimationHelper.playAnimation(player, name, 10)`
   - Avoid animations during `speed_attack_sword` or `ragnaraku` to prevent particle conflicts
   - Always play attack animations even when ability misses (for visual consistency)

4. **Movement & Physics**:
   - **Velocity-based movement**: Use `player.setDeltaMovement(velocity)` for smooth motion
   - **Teleportation**: Use `player.teleportTo(x, y, z)` for instant movement
   - **Rotation**: Set `player.setYRot()`, `player.setXRot()`, and `player.setYHeadRot()`
   - **Anti-gravity**: Set Y velocity to positive value each tick during hover abilities

### Testing Commands
- `/testanim` - Test animation sync across multiplayer
- `/testanimc` - Test client-side animation triggering
- Debug logging can be enabled in config for particle and animation troubleshooting

### Mod Compatibility

#### ShoulderSurfing Integration
The mod includes optional integration with [ShoulderSurfing Reloaded](https://github.com/Exopandora/ShoulderSurfing) mod:
- Uses reflection to detect if ShoulderSurfing is loaded (no hard dependency required)
- When present, automatically syncs camera rotation during breathing technique abilities
- Falls back gracefully if ShoulderSurfing is not installed
- Implementation in `PlayerRotationSyncPacket.java` using `ModList.get().isLoaded("shouldersurfing")`
- No configuration changes needed - works automatically when both mods are present

## Critical Bug Prevention: log4j LinkageError Crashes

### Problem Overview

The mod experienced persistent crashes with the error:
```
java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: loader 'MC-BOOTSTRAP' wants to load interface org.apache.logging.log4j.util.MessageSupplier
```

This crash occurred specifically when attacking living entities (zombies, etc.) and was caused by a combination of issues related to log4j and event handling.

### Root Causes

1. **Infinite Event Recursion**
   - The `onLivingAttack` event handler was calling `entity.hurt()` to apply AOE damage
   - Each `hurt()` call triggered another `LivingAttackEvent`
   - This created infinite recursion: LivingAttackEvent โ hurt() โ LivingAttackEvent โ hurt() โ ...
   - Eventually an exception would be thrown due to stack overflow or other issues

2. **log4j ClassLoader Conflicts**
   - When the exception occurred, Forge's EventBus tried to log it using log4j
   - Multiple mods/dependencies had bundled their own log4j classes
   - This created a classloader conflict where two versions of log4j's `MessageSupplier` interface existed
   - The MC-BOOTSTRAP classloader couldn't resolve which version to use, causing LinkageError

3. **Uncaught Exceptions in Event Handlers**
   - Exceptions in event handlers would bubble up to EventBus.handleException()
   - EventBus then tried to log these using log4j, triggering the LinkageError
   - The original exception was masked by the logging error

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Prevent Event Recursion (CRITICAL)

Added a `ThreadLocal<Boolean>` flag to prevent recursive event handling:

```java
// In KimetsunoyaibaMultiplayer.java
private static final ThreadLocal<Boolean> IS_PROCESSING_AOE = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> false);

@SubscribeEvent
public void onLivingAttack(LivingAttackEvent event) {
    try {
        // Prevent recursion from AOE attacks triggering more events
        if (IS_PROCESSING_AOE.get()) {
            return;
        }

        // ... existing code ...

        // Set flag before dealing AOE damage
        IS_PROCESSING_AOE.set(true);
        try {
            for (LivingEntity entity : nearbyEntities) {
                entity.hurt(attacker.level().damageSources().playerAttack(attacker), damage);
            }
        } finally {
            IS_PROCESSING_AOE.set(false);
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Always catch exceptions
    }
}
```

**Why ThreadLocal?** Multiple threads may be processing events simultaneously. ThreadLocal ensures each thread has its own flag.

#### 2. Disable log4j in Custom Logging Class

Replaced all log4j logging with System.out.println in `Log.java`:

```java
public static void debug(String message, Object... args) {
    if (Config.logDebug)
        //LOGGER.debug(message, args);  // DISABLED - causes LinkageError
        System.out.println("[DEBUG] " + format(message, args));
}
```

**Why?** Even with try-catch blocks, log4j calls could still trigger LinkageErrors. Using System.out bypasses log4j entirely.

#### 3. Exclude log4j from All Dependencies

Added log4j exclusions to `build.gradle`:

```gradle
implementation(fg.deobf("dev.kosmx.player-anim:player-animation-lib-forge:${player_anim_version}")) {
    exclude group: 'org.apache.logging.log4j', module: 'log4j-api'
    exclude group: 'org.apache.logging.log4j', module: 'log4j-core'
    exclude group: 'org.slf4j', module: 'slf4j-api'
}

implementation(fg.deobf("software.bernie.geckolib:geckolib-forge-${geckolib_version}")) {
    exclude group: 'org.apache.logging.log4j', module: 'log4j-api'
    exclude group: 'org.apache.logging.log4j', module: 'log4j-core'
    exclude group: 'org.slf4j', module: 'slf4j-api'
}

runtimeOnly(fg.deobf("lib:mobplayeranimator-forge:${project.mob_player_anim_version}-all")) {
    exclude group: 'org.apache.logging.log4j', module: 'log4j-api'
    exclude group: 'org.apache.logging.log4j', module: 'log4j-core'
    exclude group: 'org.slf4j', module: 'slf4j-api'
}
```

**Why?** Prevents dependencies from bundling their own log4j versions that conflict with Minecraft's log4j.

#### 4. Comprehensive Try-Catch Blocks

Wrapped ALL event handlers in try-catch blocks:

```java
@SubscribeEvent
public static void onLeftClickEmpty(InputEvent.InteractionKeyMappingTriggered event) {
    try {
        // Event handler logic
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Silently catch to prevent crashes
        if (Config.logDebug) {
            System.err.println("Error in onLeftClickEmpty: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Critical**: Use `System.err.println()` in catch blocks, NOT `Log.debug()` or any log4j-based logging.

### Prevention Guidelines

When adding new features, follow these rules to avoid similar crashes:

#### Rule 1: Never Call hurt() Inside LivingAttackEvent Without Recursion Protection

**BAD:**
```java
@SubscribeEvent
public void onLivingAttack(LivingAttackEvent event) {
    // This will cause infinite recursion!
    entity.hurt(damageSource, damage);
}
```

**GOOD:**
```java
@SubscribeEvent
public void onLivingAttack(LivingAttackEvent event) {
    if (IS_PROCESSING_FLAG.get()) return;

    IS_PROCESSING_FLAG.set(true);
    try {
        entity.hurt(damageSource, damage);
    } finally {
        IS_PROCESSING_FLAG.set(false);
    }
}
```

#### Rule 2: Always Wrap Event Handlers in Try-Catch

**BAD:**
```java
@SubscribeEvent
public void onSomeEvent(SomeEvent event) {
    // Exception can escape to EventBus
    riskyOperation();
}
```

**GOOD:**
```java
@SubscribeEvent
public void onSomeEvent(SomeEvent event) {
    try {
        riskyOperation();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

#### Rule 3: Never Use log4j Logging in Exception Handlers

**BAD:**
```java
try {
    // code
} catch (Exception e) {
    Log.error("Error occurred", e);  // Can trigger LinkageError!
}
```

**GOOD:**
```java
try {
    // code
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.err.println("Error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
    e.printStackTrace();  // Safe to use
}
```

#### Rule 4: Exclude log4j from All External Dependencies

When adding new dependencies to `build.gradle`:

```gradle
implementation(fg.deobf("some.dependency:artifact:version")) {
    exclude group: 'org.apache.logging.log4j', module: 'log4j-api'
    exclude group: 'org.apache.logging.log4j', module: 'log4j-core'
    exclude group: 'org.slf4j', module: 'slf4j-api'
}
```

#### Rule 5: Be Careful with Event Chains

Common event chains that can cause recursion:
- `LivingAttackEvent` โ `hurt()` โ `LivingAttackEvent`
- `LivingHurtEvent` โ `hurt()` โ `LivingHurtEvent`
- `PlayerInteractEvent` โ `useOn()` โ `PlayerInteractEvent`
- `BlockEvent.BreakEvent` โ `destroyBlock()` โ `BlockEvent.BreakEvent`

**Always** use flags or early returns to prevent these chains from becoming infinite loops.

### Debugging Similar Crashes

If you encounter a log4j LinkageError in the future:

1. **Check the stack trace** for the actual source of the exception (before the LinkageError)
   - Look for the deepest call from your mod's code
   - The crash report shows "Suspected Mod" which helps identify the source

2. **Look for event recursion**
   - Search for patterns like: Event handler โ action โ same event โ handler โ action...
   - Add debug logging to see if handlers are being called repeatedly

3. **Add recursion protection**
   - Use ThreadLocal flags to track when you're already processing an event
   - Always use try-finally to ensure flags are cleared

4. **Replace log4j calls**
   - In the problematic code path, replace `Log.*()` calls with `System.out.println()`
   - Especially in exception handlers

5. **Test incrementally**
   - After each fix, test specifically with the action that was causing crashes
   - In our case: attacking zombies with breathing swords
