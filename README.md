# Kimetsunoyaiba Multiplayer (Forge)

A Forge mod that adds **multiplayer synchronization** for mods using the [PlayerAnimator](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/playeranimator) library.  

Specifically this mod was made such that animations from the [Kimetsunoyaiba mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/demonslayer) are visible in multiplayer.

By default, PlayerAnimator animations are **only visible on the local client**. This mod fixes that limitation by sending animation state over the network, allowing **all players** in a world or server to see each otherâ€™s custom animations (for example, in the [Kimetsu no Yaiba mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kimetsunoyaiba)).

## âœ¨ Features
- Detects when a player starts/stops an animation.  
- Sends animation data (player, animation name, looping flag) to the server.  
- Server rebroadcasts this animation to nearby clients.  
- Other clients play the animation on the correct player using MobPlayerAnimator (since PlayerAnimator only animates the client player).  
- Works in both **LAN** and **dedicated servers**, as long as everyone has this mod installed.

- **PlayerAnimator** mod (installed on both client and server).
