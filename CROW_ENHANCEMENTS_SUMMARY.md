# Kasugai Crow Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds configurable enhancements to the `kimetsunoyaiba:kasugai_crow` entity from the Kimetsu no Yaiba mod, including flying dodge mechanics and automatic quest waypoint detection.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Flying Dodge Mechanic ✨ IMPROVED
- **Tamed crows** automatically fly away when taking damage (non-fall damage)
- **Two-phase flight**:
  - **Phase 1 - Fast Takeoff**: Rapid vertical ascent (2.5 blocks/tick) until reaching flight height
  - **Phase 2 - Circular Flight**: Fast circular pattern (full circle in ~1.5 seconds) at 25 blocks altitude
- Flight duration: 60 seconds (1200 ticks) by default
- Circular flight pattern with configurable radius (25 blocks default)
- **Dynamic circle center**: Circle follows owner's X/Z position as they move
- Gravity is disabled during flight to ensure smooth movement
- **Fall damage prevention**: Crows never take fall damage
- If attacked while flying or landing, flight duration extends by 5 seconds
- Cloud particles indicate takeoff and wing flaps during flight (every 5 ticks)

### 2. Automatic Quest Detection
- **Monitors chat messages** for crow quest notifications
- Pattern matches messages like: `"Mt Sagiri  is at 12 ~ 57"` or `"Location Name is at X ~ Z"`
- Automatically creates waypoint markers when quest is detected
- Works with any location name and coordinate format

### 3. Quest Waypoint System
- **Visual Arrow**: END_ROD particles point from player toward quest location
- **Waypoint Beacon**: Vertical flame beam with circling particles at target location
- **Distance-based completion**: Player only needs to get within 2 blocks (X/Z, Y ignored)
- **Celebration effects**: Level-up sound + HAPPY_VILLAGER particles when reached
- **Auto-expiration**: Waypoints disappear after 60 seconds (configurable)

## Configuration File
Location: `config/kimetsunoyaibamultiplayer/entities.toml`

```toml
[entities.kasugai_crow]
    # Master toggle for all crow enhancements
    enhancements-enabled = true

    # Flying dodge mechanic
    flying-dodge-enabled = true
    flight-height = 25.0          # Blocks above starting position
    flight-duration = 1200        # Ticks (60 seconds)
    circle-radius = 25.0          # Radius of circular flight path

    # Quest marker system
    quest-arrow-enabled = true    # Show directional arrow
    waypoint-enabled = true       # Show waypoint beacon
    arrow-update-interval = 5     # Ticks between arrow updates
    arrow-length = 3.0            # Length of arrow in blocks

    # Waypoint behavior
    waypoint-duration = 1200      # How long waypoints last (60 seconds)
    waypoint-complete-distance = 2.0  # Distance to complete (X/Z only)
    auto-detect-quests = true     # Auto-detect crow quest messages in chat
```

## New Features Added

### 2.1. Smart Teleport Redirection
- When a flying crow tries to teleport to owner (on ground), it's redirected to 20-30 blocks above the owner instead
- Prevents crow from being forced to ground while in defensive flight mode
- Circle center updates to new position after teleport
- Only triggers when teleport target is within 5 blocks of owner

## Testing Commands

### Test Quest Markers
```
/testcrowquest <x> <y> <z> [duration]
```
Example: `/testcrowquest ~ ~5 ~100 1200` - Creates waypoint 100 blocks forward

### Clear Quest Marker
```
/clearcrowquest
```
Removes your current waypoint marker

### Debug Crow Entity (NEW)
```
/debugcrow
```
Inspects nearby kasugai_crow entities and logs all available methods/fields related to flying/animation
Use this to understand what animation capabilities the crow entity has

## How to Test

### Flying Dodge Mechanic:
1. Tame a kasugai_crow in-game
2. Attack the crow (with a sword, etc.)
3. Observe: Damage is cancelled, cloud particles appear, crow flies upward
4. Watch debug logs to see flight state updates
5. Crow should fly in circles for ~60 seconds then land

### Quest Waypoint System:
1. Right-click a crow to get a quest message
2. Chat should show something like `"Mt Sagiri  is at 12 ~ 57"`
3. Waypoint automatically appears with arrow pointing to location
4. Walk to the location (within 2 blocks X/Z)
5. Hear level-up sound and see celebration particles
6. Waypoint disappears

## Debug Logging
Enable debug mode in `config/kimetsunoyaibamultiplayer/common.toml`:
```toml
[common]
    log-debug = true
```

Debug logs will show:
- Crow damage events and flying state changes
- Chat message parsing and waypoint creation
- Flight updates every second
- Waypoint completion detection

## Architecture

### Files Created/Modified:

#### New Files:
1. **`config/EntityConfig.java`** - Configuration for all crow enhancements
2. **`entities/CrowEnhancementHandler.java`** - Flying dodge mechanic and state management
3. **`entities/CrowQuestMarkerHandler.java`** - Quest detection and waypoint rendering
4. **`commands/TestCrowQuestCommand.java`** - Testing command for waypoints
5. **`commands/DebugCrowCommand.java`** - Command to inspect crow entity structure
6. **`client/CrowAnimationHandler.java`** - Attempts to trigger flying animations via reflection

#### Modified Files:
1. **`KimetsunoyaibaMultiplayer.java`** - Registered new config, events, and commands

### Event Handlers:
- **`LivingHurtEvent`** - Catches crow damage for dodge mechanic
- **`EntityTeleportEvent`** - Intercepts crow teleports and redirects to above owner when flying
- **`ServerTickEvent`** - Updates flying crow positions server-side
- **`ClientTickEvent`** - Renders waypoint markers client-side
- **`ClientChatReceivedEvent`** - Monitors chat for quest messages

## Technical Details

### Flying Mechanics:
- **Two-phase flight system**:
  - Phase 1: Fast vertical takeoff (2.0-2.5 blocks/tick) until reaching target height
  - Phase 2: Fast circular flight (0.2 radians/tick, 0.6 speed multiplier)
- Uses `Entity.setNoGravity(true)` to disable gravity during flight
- Calculates circular path using trigonometry: `x = centerX + cos(angle) * radius`
- Circle center dynamically follows owner's position
- Updates velocity each tick to move crow along calculated path
- Stores state per-crow UUID in static HashMap
- Cleans up state when crow lands or is unloaded
- Random starting angle prevents synchronized flight patterns

### Quest Detection:
- Regex pattern: `(.+?)\s+is at\s+(-?\\d+)\s*~\s*(-?\\d+)`
- Case-insensitive matching
- Handles extra spaces in location names
- Defaults Y coordinate to 64 (surface level)

### Waypoint Rendering:
- Arrow: Multiple END_ROD particles in line toward target
- Beacon: Vertical flame beam with rotating END_ROD particles
- Completion check: `sqrt((playerX - targetX)² + (playerZ - targetZ)²) <= distance`
- Y coordinate is ignored for completion

## Animation Support

### Current Status:
The crow entity likely uses its own animation system from the kimetsunoyaiba mod. We've implemented:

1. **CrowAnimationHandler** - Attempts to trigger flying animations via reflection
   - Tries common method names: `setFlying()`, `setIsFlying()`, `startFlying()`
   - Tries common field names: `flying`, `isFlying`
   - Falls back gracefully if crow doesn't support these

2. **Debug Command** - `/debugcrow` to inspect crow entity structure
   - Lists all methods/fields related to flying/animation/wings
   - Helps identify if custom animations are available

3. **Visual Cues** - Even without custom animations:
   - Fast movement creates visual impression of flight
   - Frequent cloud particles simulate wing flaps
   - Body rotation follows flight direction

### To Add Custom Flying Animation:
The kasugai_crow entity from the kimetsunoyaiba mod determines what animations are available. Options:

1. **If crow has fly animation**: Run `/debugcrow` near a crow to see available methods
2. **If not**: Follow KASUGAI_CROW_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md to create GeckoLib model with animations
3. **Model replacement**: Use Mixins to replace renderer (see KimetsunoyaibaModels project)

## Known Limitations

1. **Animation**: Depends on what the kimetsunoyaiba mod's crow entity supports
   - We attempt to trigger animations programmatically
   - Visual flight behavior works regardless of animation support
   - Use `/debugcrow` command to see what's available

2. **Model**: Uses existing crow model without modifications
   - Enhancement plan includes GeckoLib conversion with flying animations
   - Current implementation works with existing model

3. **Multiplayer**: Flying state is server-authoritative
   - Clients see crow movement but don't predict it
   - Network sync handled by vanilla entity tracking

## Future Enhancements (from KASUGAI_CROW_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md)

- [ ] Custom GeckoLib model with flying animations
- [ ] Replace crow model and renderer using Mixins
- [ ] Add "dodge_takeoff", "flying_circles", and "landing" animations
- [ ] Energy/cooldown system to prevent spam dodging
- [ ] Flock behavior for multiple crows
- [ ] Sound effects for each flight state

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - All features compiled and ready for testing

## Troubleshooting

### Crow not flying when damaged:
1. Check crow is tamed (`/data get entity @e[type=kimetsunoyaiba:kasugai_crow,limit=1]`)
2. Enable debug logging and check for "Crow is not tamed" messages
3. Verify `flying-dodge-enabled = true` in config
4. Check console for "=== INITIATING CROW FLIGHT ===" message
5. Look for "Crow reached flight height, starting circular pattern" after ~10 ticks

### Crow not circling (just going up):
1. Check debug logs for "Crow circling: pos=..." messages
2. Verify crow reached flight height (should see "Crow reached flight height" message)
3. Check that `reachedFlightHeight` flag is set to true in logs
4. Flight pattern should show angle increasing: `angle=0.2, 0.4, 0.6...`

### Crow teleporting to ground instead of above player:
1. Look for "Redirected flying crow teleport" messages in console
2. Verify crow is in flying state when teleport occurs
3. Check `EntityTeleportEvent` is being caught (look for debug messages)
4. Teleport should redirect to Y + 20-30 blocks above owner

### Waypoint not appearing from chat:
1. Enable debug logging
2. Check console for "Parsed crow quest:" messages
3. Verify chat message format matches pattern (e.g., "Location is at X ~ Z")
4. Check `auto-detect-quests = true` in config
5. Use `/testcrowquest` command to manually test waypoints

### No flying animation visible:
1. Run `/debugcrow` near a crow to see available animation methods
2. Check console output for methods containing "fly", "anim", or "wing"
3. If no animation support, consider implementing custom model (see KASUGAI_CROW_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md)
4. Visual flight behavior (fast movement + particles) works regardless of animation
