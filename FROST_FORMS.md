## Seventh Form: Golden Senses

The users sword glows bright yellow, replicating the rising sun. The users attacks hit harder and move faster in the duration of the form.
Temporarily switch the sword's model to the nichirinsword_golden from our mod, and give the user increased haste, speed, and strength and nightvision (the user will probably already have these potion effects, in which case give them 1 level higher than what they already have), for a duration of 20 seconds. After those 20 seconds, the sword's model goes back to normal
This should have like a 40 second cooldown on the sword.
Animation: kimetsunoyaiba:kaishin3 (just when the sword first turns golden)
Sounds: kimetsunoyaiba:awakening
