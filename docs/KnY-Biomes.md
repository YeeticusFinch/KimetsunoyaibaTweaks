# KimetsunoYaiba Biomes

Orca's KimetsunoYaiba Mod adds the following biomes:

- mt_natagumo
- mt_yoko
- mt_sagiri
- mugen_biome (spawns in mugen dimension)
- biome_enmu_dream (spawns in enmu dream dimension)

Out of these, two of the biomes don't work: mt_natagumo and mt_yoko

## How do fix this?

One way of fixing this is with the [Biome Replacer mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/biome-replacer)

Biome Replacer let's you replace biomes in your game with a different biome, or remove biomes entirely.

You can use Biome Replacer to swap out some vanilla biomes (or biomes from a different mod, or some custom biomes from a datapack) with `kimetsunoyaiba:mt_natagumo` and `kimetsunoyaiba:mt_yoko`, and now you will see those two biomes in your world, and the crow will properly point towards it.

This is a little tedious, and it means that you have to forfeit two biomes in your world (unless you add more with a datapack or a mod).

## Planned feature

I am currently investigating how to add these missing biomes to the game with my add-on
